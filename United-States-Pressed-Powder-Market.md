This can be attributed to the higher usage of cosmetics among women and their preference for products that provide an easy, on-the-go solution for maintaining a flawless complexion. Women of various age groups are increasingly opting for pressed powders due to their portability, ease of use, and variety in formulations. These powders help women achieve smooth, even skin tone and reduce excess oil production, making them ideal for daily wear. Additionally, women are also seeking products that are lightweight yet provide sufficient coverage, and pressed powders meet these needs by offering a matte finish without the heaviness of liquid foundations.Moreover, the growing trend of clean and sustainable beauty has had a positive impact on the women’s segment. Pressed powders that are formulated with natural ingredients and free from harmful chemicals are seeing greater adoption. Women today are more informed about the ingredients in their beauty products and prefer pressed powders that align with their eco-conscious values. The increasing presence of organic and cruelty-free pressed powder brands further supports growth in this subsegment. As beauty standards continue to evolve, women’s demand for products that are versatile, easy to use, and suitable for all skin types will likely continue to drive market expansion.<h2>Men</h2><p>While traditionally the pressed powder market has been dominated by women, the demand for men's beauty and grooming products, including pressed powders, has grown significantly. Men are increasingly seeking products that enhance their appearance subtly while maintaining a natural look. In recent years, there has been a noticeable rise in the adoption of pressed powders by men, especially for oil control, shine reduction, and to even out skin tone. Many men prefer pressed powders as they are easy to apply and can be used for both a matte finish and lightweight coverage, often without the need for more extensive makeup products. The growing societal acceptance of male grooming trends is contributing to the rising demand in this segment.The shift towards gender-neutral beauty products is also influencing the men’s segment of the market. Men’s pressed powders are often marketed as unisex products, designed to cater to both the need for functional skincare and subtle makeup applications.
